         -w, --warning=INTEGER:INTEGER
        Minimum and maximum number of allowable result, outside of which a
        warning will be generated.  If omitted, no warning is generated.

         -c, --critical=INTEGER:INTEGER
        Minimum and maximum number of the generated result, outside of
        which a critical will be generated.

         -h, --host
        POP3 Host (defaults to localhost.localdomain)

         -u, --username
        POP3 Username

         -p, --password
        POP3 password

         --count
        Count the number of messages on the server. The messages on the server are not modified.
        This is the default action.

         --delete
        Delete all messages on the server. Counts how many messages were deleted.

         -t, --timeout=INTEGER
           Seconds before plugin times out (default: 15)
         -v, --verbose
           Show details for command-line debugging (can repeat up to 3 times)
        Currently only two POP3 mailbox actions are supported: count and delete

        Count - Counts the number of messages on the server. The messages are not modified.
        Delete - Deletes all messages on the server (and returns then number deleted)

        THRESHOLDs for -w and -c are specified 'min:max' or 'min:' or ':max'
        (or 'max'). If specified '@min:max', a warning status will be generated
        if the count *is* inside the specified range.

    For example, if you have a process that sends an email to a pop3 mailbox
    once per day, you can get nagios to check the mailbox for a single
    message (and delete all messages) every day via:

        nagios_plugin_pop3 -h myhost -u myname -p mypass -c 1:1 --delete
